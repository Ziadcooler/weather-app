# 🌤️ weathery


weathery is a weather app made by me!!
like my last project, shrtnd, a URL shortener, this one also has both its frontend and backend deployed on Render — a service that lets you host static sites and web services (for free!!).
i could've used AWS or something but eh

🔗 live site
👉 weathery-5ijy.onrender.com
yeah, there's a weird code in the URL — it's a free render domain and i can't be bothered to set up a custom one (or buy one haha), so this is what we’re working with.

⚙️ backend endpoint
just in case you're curious, the backend lives at:
weathery-service.onrender.com
you probably don’t need it sooooooo

🖥️ desktop client (Windows)
to get the windows version of weathery:

head over to the Releases section

download the .zip or .exe file

run the app — no install needed

if you want to build it yourself:

open the .sln file in Visual Studio 2022

set the build config to Release and Any CPU

hit build and find the .exe inside bin/Release

feel free to peek at the C# code too if you're into that sort of thing.
